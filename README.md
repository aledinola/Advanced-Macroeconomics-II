# Advanced-Macroeconomics-II
This is some of the material I covered for my course "Advanced Macroeconomics II" taught at the University of Konstanz. The course cover three main topics in macroeconomics (master/first year PhD level):
* Overlapping generations models
* Overlapping generations and economic growth
* Incomplete markets and wealth inequality
* Job search and unemployment
* Search and matching models of the labor market
